# AlexNet-LeNet-5-and-VGG-Net-on-CIFAR-10
AlexNet, LeNet-5 and VGG Net are famous networks, I am interested in how it performs on the CIFAR-10 database
AlexNet here could reach accuracy of 90%.
VGG19 could reach about 80%-85%.
LeNet-5 reach only 60%.

Please be remined that the network is deep, please run the program on GPU if possible. I runned them with my RTX3070 and it takes about 1hours.
